					<h3><b><u>Dharma Teacher Order</u></b></h3>
					<p>
						"The Dharma Teacher Order is a group of monastics and lay people who follow the Vietnamese Zen (Thien) Buddhist tradition 
						and are interested in:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Learning more about the Dharma (Buddha&#39;s teachings)
							</li>
							<li>
								Developing our spiritual practices and 
							</li>
							<li>
								Making the Dharma available to the Western Hemisphere.
							</li>
						</ol>
						We are respectful of all Buddhist traditions as well as other religious denominations and welcome interaction with all of them. 
						This is a four-year certificate program with an introduction to Buddhism, Buddhist sutras, and Buddhist thought. The course is 
						a wonderful way to cultivate a more conscious and balanced life and helping yourself and others realize liberation from suffering."<br><br>
						Please Note: DTO classes are held via Zoom and combine students from all participating sanghas. Our temple will continue to host 
						a class that joins Zoom together for those who want to gather in person.<br><br>
						Q. Who can participate? <br>
						A. Everyone is invited to attend and participate in our services, presentations, and special events. There are no special 
						requirements to audit, and we welcome all who want to learn more about the Buddha&#39;s teachings and practices.<br><br>
						Q. Do participants earn a certificate?<br>
						A. For those who are interested, students completing all four years of study (and associated requirements) can receive a 
						<a href="http://dharmateacherorder.org/course/">Certificate of Buddhist Studies</a>. Students who complete a fifth+ year of study may be eligible to receive ordination as a 
						<a href="http://dharmateacherorder.org/course/teacher-training/">Lay Dharma Teacher in the DTO.</a><br><br>
						Q. How much does the program cost?<br>
						A. Annual tuition is $150, plus retreat costs; we also welcome and encourage students to donate what they are able to when 
						possible to support the program. We make it easy to donate <a href="donate-sponsor.html">online here</a>, or through many of the donation boxes at the temple. All 
						donations by students support costs related to the program, including temple upkeep, retreat costs, and program materials. If you 
						make an online donation through PayPal, please add a note that the donation is "for DTO". If a check is placed in a physical 
						donation box, please write "DTO" on the bottom of the check.<br><br>
						Q. What about books?<br>
						A. Students are also responsible for purchasing their own books, many of which can be found used or at your local library. 
						Please ask us for more help if you have trouble with finding or paying for these books. A full list of the books currently used 
						during all four years of study is available <a href="http://dharmateacherorder.org/book-list/">at the DTO website</a>.<br><br>
						Q. What happens during a typical class session?<br>
						A. We encourage all students to prepare for class through chanting and meditation. You can practice at home, or join the Texas 
						or Missouri sanghas (in-person or online) on Saturday morning before class. Classes begin at noon and conclude by 3 pm. From 12 
						to 1:15 pm, a student then makes a presentation on the content of our reading assignment. We then take a personal break, followed 
						by walking meditation. We return to class at 1:45 for a facilitated discussion on the material, concluding with announcements. 
						Presentations are made by our students, with support from DTO mentors.<br><br>
						Q. How can I keep up to date about the classes?<br>
						A. For more information, visit the <a href="http://dharmateacherorder.org/">Dharma Teacher Order website</a> or <a href="mailto: dinhquangbuddhistservice@gmail.com">contact David</a>.  Thank you!<br><br>
