                    Namo A Di Da Phat!<br><br>
                    One practice you may notice when you visit  Dinh Quang Temple is the wearing of temple robes. The monastics often  
                    wear yellow robes. For the Vietnamese service, the community wears the  traditional blue-grey robes common to temples 
                    in Vietnam and the  diaspora. For the ecumenical English-speaking service, the community  wears dark brown robes. On 
                    Saturday, April 7, 2018, the Venerable Thich  Thong Chanh offered us a teaching on this practice.<br><br>
                    Wearing a robe is a bell of mindfulness, a reminder to the community in at least four ways:<br><br>
                    First, the robes are a simple color, inviting and reminding the  community to practice simplicity and humility, both 
                    at the temple and  throughout their daily lives. <br><br>
                    Second, the robes remind us to  respect the Triple Gem, the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. As a community  of practice, 
                    aspiring to the Buddha&#39;s path, this also reminds us to  respect one another.<br><br>
                    Third, the robes remind us to be mindful  of our habits. When you are wearing a robe, it is easier to remember, to  
                    notice when you are about to do or say something that you would like to  restrain. The robe also helps us to focus the 
                    mind and remember and  keep our aspirations, our commitment to acting with greater kindness and  wisdom.<br><br>
                    Fourth, the robes remind us that we are a community  and that we represent the temple. At times, we also wear the robes 
                    in  public, such as at funerals or during hospital visits.<br><br>
                    The  venerable concluded by sharing his personal experience of wearing a  robe: “When I wear this, it reminds me, 
                    &#39;you are a monk.&#39; It reminds me  to honor everyone.”<br><br>
                    Thank you, Master Thay, for your teaching and example!
